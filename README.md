Modern Sockets
==============

This project contains sample programs demonstrating
how modern sockets work.

There are more years since the Sockets API was created
in 1983, than there were in turn between Sockets and
the first commercial computers (Univac and IBM) that
shipped in the early 1950s. College networking
classes miss much that has transpired since then,
such as scalability, multi-core program, encryption,
and so on.

This project contains numerous examples of what 
students should learn. On one hand, many of these
are "advanced" examples, in that they go beyond
the typical textbook. On the other hand, they
should be considered basic examples, in that 
real-world network code will use these concepts.
